# udaan
Udaan is a pioneering women empowering organization working on the issue of giving life and hope in the lives of women who were thrashed recklessly by the orthodox cliche of the society.
 Udaan works on the five pillars of Prevention, Protection, Rescue, Rehabilitation & Reintegration. 
 Our main objective is to make this one of the most powerful voices nationally and globally for ensuring holistic victim services.
Description : 
Our aim is to provide aid to the needy women, encourage them morally, provide them support groups and create awareness among them.
We believe development goes by hand in hand. Our approach is to make a platform worthy to handle queries related to the women's issue.
We want to make women believe that they still have life ahead of them and here again we will provide all the possible opportunities to our mockingbirds.
We will try our level best to give them the amazing self-confidence by our very own special interaction programs and make sure to make them independent by providing them different job opportunities.
